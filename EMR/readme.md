## âš¡ EMR/Spark - Data Transformations Done & Rationale

- The raw NYC Taxi data is transformed to ensure quality and analytics readiness for further downstream purposes.
- The code for the same is available in this folder. Use this in the EMR Step.

Transformations done:

1. **Extract Year & Month:** Derived from filename and pickup datetime to enable time-based filtering and partitioning.  
2. **Timestamp Conversion:** Converts pickup/dropoff strings to timestamps for accurate duration calculations.  
3. **Filter Invalid Trips:** Removes trips with zero distance, negative duration, or zero passengers.  
4. **Compute Effective Fare:** Aggregates fare components to handle missing values.  
5. **Outlier Removal:** Filters extreme values using percentiles to improve data reliability.  
6. **Map Payment Type & Flags:** Converts codes to meaningful labels and boolean flags.  
7. **Join Lookup Data:** Enriches pickup location info with borough, zone, and service zone.  
8. **Output:** Writes clean data to S3 in Parquet, partitioned by month.

## Some Example Benefits

### 1) Compression 

Converting CSV to Parquet **reduces file sizes by roughly 1/4**, improving storage efficiency and query performance.

   **a) Original CSV Sizes:**

   **b) Parquet File Sizes:**

   **c) Partition Parquet Structure:**

### 2) Partitioning

Parquet files are partitioned by `month`, which improves query performance by **reading only relevant partitions** instead of the full dataset.

  **a) Reading via Existing Timestamp Column:**

```

  **b) Reading via Partition:**

### 3) Improved Data Quality

The transformations help us clear outlier values that would affect the analysis on the data. 

For e.g. 
- In 2023, the minimum fare in NYC would start around 5 usd.
- Why ? - Cause of the mandatory base fare and taxes paid.
- Hence fares having values less than this does not make sense.
- Therfore using percentiles [0.005, 0.995] we clean the very extreme outliers
- Similarly we tracked same location dropoffs, zero or negative travel distances and other similar issues and removed them.
